    <p>
      The web servers of the AET are operated by the AET itself, based in Boltzmannstr. 3, 85748 Garching b. Munich. Every time our website is accessed, the web server temporarily
      processes the following information in log files:
    </p>
    <br />
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>IP address of the requesting computer</li>
      <li>Date and time of access</li>
      <li>Name, URL and transferred data volume of the retrieved file</li>
      <li>Access status (requested file transferred, not found, etc.)</li>
      <li>Identification data of the browser and operating system used (if transmitted by the requesting web browser)</li>
      <li>Web page from which access was made (if transmitted by the requesting web browser) The processing of the data in this log file can be done as follows:</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>The processing of the data in this log file takes place as follows:</p>
    <br />
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>The log entries are continuously updated automatically evaluated in order to be able to detect attacks on the web server and react accordingly.</li>
      <li>In individual cases, i.e. in the case of reported disruptions, errors and security incidents, a manual analysis is carried out.</li>
      <li>The IP addresses contained in the log entries are not merged with other databases by AET, so that no conclusions can be drawn about individual persons.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Use and transfer of personal data</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Our website can be used without providing personal data. All services that might require any form of personal data (e.g. registration for events, contact forms) are offered
      on external sites, linked here. The use of contact data published as part of the imprint obligation by third parties to send unsolicited advertising and information material
      is hereby prohibited. The operators of the pages reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam
      mails.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Revocation of your consent to data processing</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Some data processing operations require your express consent possible. You can revoke your consent that you have already given at any time. A message bye-mail is sufficient
      for the revocation. The lawfulness of the data processing that took place up until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Right to file a complaint with the responsible supervisory authority</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      If you believe that the processing of your personal data violates applicable data protection laws, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
      <br /><br />
      Since this project is developed at the <strong>Technical University of Munich (TUM)</strong>, a public institution in Bavaria, the applicable law is the
      <strong>Bavarian Data Protection Act (BayDSG)</strong>, which supplements the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>. The responsible supervisory
      authority for enforcing these regulations is: <br /><br />
      <strong>Bavarian State Commissioner for Data Protection (BayLfD)</strong><br />
      Wagmüllerstraße 18<br />
      80538 Munich<br />

      feasible.
