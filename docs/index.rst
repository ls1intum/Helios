Introduction
------------

The Artemis open-source project relies on GitHub Actions for its CI/CD workflows but faces challenges such as complex workflows, lack of user-friendly deployment management, and limited test analytics. This project aims to enhance the CI/CD capabilities of Artemis by developing a centralized web application that integrates with GitHub Actions. The proposed solution will provide a streamlined platform for managing deployments, environment tracking, and test analytics, accessible through an intuitive interface.
