### Greek mythology

Helios was the Greek god and personification of the sun :sun_with_face: Each day, he was said to drive a golden chariot across the sky, bringing light to the world. According to mythology, Helios rose in the east and traveled across the heavens, guiding his chariot pulled by four horses. His daily journey from dawn to dusk symbolized reliability, consistency, and illumination.

Helios was also often depicted with a radiant crown, symbolizing the sun's light, and was considered an all-seeing deity, which aligns well with themes of visibility and clarity. These qualities made Helios a powerful symbol of insight and oversight in Greek culture.
