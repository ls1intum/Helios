Helios brings clarity and control to GitHub Actions based CI/CD workflows. Named after the Greek god of the sun—symbolizing insight, reliability, and visibility—Helios offers:

- 🌟 **Unified Dashboard**  
  All your branches, PRs, builds, test suites, and deployments in one canvas. Helios automatically syncs with GitHub, so you always see the latest activity.

- 🚀 **Smooth Deployment Flow**  
  Pick from available environments with a friendly UI. Helios locks your chosen environment, prevents collisions, and displays live progress until tests finish or a timeout is reached.

- 🔍 **Test Insights**  
  No more scrolling through raw logs. Helios ingests structured reports (JUnit XML) so you can click into individual test suites and cases—see pass/fail, error messages, and log snippets. Track flaky tests across branches over time.

- 📦 **Release Management**  
  Draft, review, and publish release candidates without leaving Helios. Automatically generate release notes, tag your release, and see everything in one timeline.

### Inspiration: Greek Mythology

Helios was the Greek god and personification of the sun 🌞 Each day, he was said to drive a golden chariot across the sky, bringing light to the world. According to mythology, Helios rose in the east and traveled across the heavens, guiding his chariot pulled by four horses. His daily journey from dawn to dusk symbolized reliability, consistency, and illumination.

Helios was also often depicted with a radiant crown, symbolizing the sun's light, and was considered an all-seeing deity, which aligns well with themes of visibility and clarity. These qualities made Helios a powerful symbol of insight and oversight in Greek culture.
